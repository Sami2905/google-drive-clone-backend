# Day 4 - File Management APIs (CRUD + Folders + Trash) - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Goals Achieved

‚úÖ **CRUD APIs for files and folders** - Complete implementation  
‚úÖ **Hierarchical folder structures** - Unlimited nesting support  
‚úÖ **Soft Delete (Trash feature)** - Recursive soft deletion  
‚úÖ **Recursive operations** - Deleting folders with children  
‚úÖ **File renaming and moving** - Enhanced file management  
‚úÖ **Breadcrumb navigation** - Complete folder path tracking  

## üìÅ Database Schema Updates

### Folder Model Enhancements
```typescript
@Entity('folders')
export class Folder {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid')
  id!: string;

  @Column()
  name!: string;

  @Column({ nullable: true })
  user_id!: string;

  @Column({ nullable: true })
  parent_id!: string | null; // Added for hierarchical structure

  @Column({ default: false })
  is_deleted!: boolean; // Added for soft deletion

  @CreateDateColumn()
  created_at!: Date;

  @UpdateDateColumn()
  updated_at!: Date;

  // Relations
  @ManyToOne(() => User, user => user.folders)
  @JoinColumn({ name: 'user_id' })
  user!: User;

  @ManyToOne(() => Folder, folder => folder.children, { nullable: true })
  @JoinColumn({ name: 'parent_id' })
  parent!: Folder;

  @OneToMany(() => Folder, folder => folder.parent)
  children!: Folder[];

  @OneToMany(() => File, file => file.folder)
  files!: File[];
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è New Components Created

### 1. Folder Service (`src/services/folderService.ts`)
**Comprehensive business logic for folder operations:**

- **Create Folder**: With parent validation and duplicate name checking
- **Get Folder Contents**: Files and subfolders within a folder
- **Get Root Contents**: Files and folders not in any folder
- **Rename Folder**: With duplicate name validation
- **Soft Delete**: Recursive deletion to trash
- **Restore Folder**: From trash with parent validation
- **Permanent Delete**: Complete removal from database and S3
- **Search Folders**: By name with pagination
- **Get Folder Path**: Breadcrumb navigation
- **Get User Folders**: With filtering and pagination

### 2. Folder Controller (`src/controllers/folderController.ts`)
**HTTP request handlers for all folder operations:**

- **POST** `/api/folders` - Create folder
- **GET** `/api/folders` - Get user's folders
- **GET** `/api/folders/root` - Get root contents
- **GET** `/api/folders/search` - Search folders
- **GET** `/api/folders/trash` - Get deleted folders
- **GET** `/api/folders/:id` - Get folder by ID
- **GET** `/api/folders/:id/contents` - Get folder contents
- **GET** `/api/folders/:id/path` - Get folder path
- **PATCH** `/api/folders/:id` - Rename folder
- **DELETE** `/api/folders/:id` - Soft delete folder
- **DELETE** `/api/folders/:id/permanent` - Permanent delete
- **POST** `/api/folders/:id/restore` - Restore from trash

### 3. Folder Routes (`src/routes/folderRoutes.ts`)
**API route definitions with authentication:**

```typescript
// Apply authentication middleware to all routes
router.use(authMiddleware);

// Folder CRUD operations
router.post('/', createFolder);
router.get('/', getUserFolders);
router.get('/root', getRootContents);
router.get('/search', searchFolders);
router.get('/trash', getTrashContents);

// Single folder operations
router.get('/:id', getFolder);
router.get('/:id/contents', getFolderContents);
router.get('/:id/path', getFolderPath);
router.patch('/:id', renameFolder);
router.delete('/:id', softDeleteFolder);
router.delete('/:id/permanent', permanentlyDeleteFolder);
router.post('/:id/restore', restoreFolder);
```

### 4. Enhanced File Management
**Updated file controller with additional operations:**

- **PATCH** `/api/files/:id` - Rename file or move to folder
- **DELETE** `/api/files/:id` - Soft delete (already existed)
- **POST** `/api/files/:id/restore` - Restore from trash (already existed)

## üîß Key Features Implemented

### 1. Hierarchical Folder Structure
- **Unlimited Nesting**: Create folders within folders without depth limits
- **Parent Validation**: Ensures parent folders exist and belong to user
- **Path Tracking**: Complete breadcrumb navigation from root to any folder
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents same-name folders in same location

### 2. Soft Delete (Trash) System
- **Recursive Soft Delete**: When a folder is moved to trash, all contents are also marked as deleted
- **Restore Capability**: Folders can be restored from trash (if parent still exists)
- **Permanent Delete**: Option to permanently delete folders and all contents
- **Trash Management**: Separate endpoint to view all deleted folders

### 3. File Organization
- **Upload to Folders**: Files can be uploaded directly to specific folders
- **Move Between Folders**: Files can be moved between folders
- **Rename Files**: File names can be updated
- **Folder Integration**: Files are properly associated with folder hierarchy

### 4. Security Features
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own folders
- **Parent Validation**: Ensures parent folders exist and belong to the user
- **Name Uniqueness**: Prevents duplicate folder names in the same location
- **Authentication Required**: All operations require valid JWT token

## üß™ Testing Examples

### Create Folder
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/folders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "My New Folder", "parent_id": "optional-parent-uuid"}'
```

### Get Folder Contents
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/folders/folder-uuid/contents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
```

### Rename Folder
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:5000/api/folders/folder-uuid \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "New Folder Name"}'
```

### Move Folder to Trash
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/folders/folder-uuid \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
```

### Restore Folder from Trash
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/folders/folder-uuid/restore \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
```

## üîÑ Recursive Operations

### Soft Delete Recursion
When a folder is soft deleted:
1. Mark the folder as `is_deleted = true`
2. Mark all files in the folder as `is_deleted = true`
3. Recursively apply the same process to all subfolders

### Permanent Delete Recursion
When a folder is permanently deleted:
1. Delete all files in the folder from S3 and database
2. Recursively delete all subfolders and their contents
3. Delete the folder itself from the database

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Indexed Queries**: Database queries are optimized with proper indexing
- **Pagination**: Large folder lists support pagination with limit/offset
- **Efficient Recursion**: Recursive operations are optimized for performance
- **Caching Ready**: API responses are structured for easy caching implementation

## üîó Integration with Existing Systems

### File System Integration
- **File Organization**: Files can be uploaded directly to specific folders
- **Bulk Operations**: Move multiple files between folders
- **Hierarchical Search**: Search files within specific folder hierarchies
- **Unified Interface**: Consistent API patterns across files and folders

### Authentication Integration
- **JWT Token Required**: All folder operations require valid authentication
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own folders
- **Permission Validation**: Ensures users can only modify their own content

## üìö Documentation

### API Documentation
- **Complete API Docs**: `docs/folder-api.md` with all endpoints
- **Request/Response Examples**: Detailed examples for each endpoint
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error response documentation
- **Testing Examples**: cURL commands for testing

### Database Schema
- **Updated Folder Model**: Added `is_deleted` and proper `parent_id` handling
- **TypeORM Integration**: Proper TypeScript types and decorators
- **Migration Ready**: Schema changes are backward compatible
