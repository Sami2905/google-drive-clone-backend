# Day 5: Sharing & Permissions - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview

Day 5 successfully implemented a comprehensive sharing and permissions system for the Google Drive clone, providing:

- **Public Link Sharing**: Generate and revoke secure public links
- **User-to-User Sharing**: Share files with specific users with role-based permissions
- **Permission Management**: View and manage file access permissions
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Three permission levels (viewer, editor, owner)
- **Secure File Access**: Integration with existing file operations

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### File Model Enhancements
- Added `is_public: boolean` field for public link status
- Added `public_token: string` field for secure public access tokens
- Updated FileResponse interface to include sharing fields

#### Permission System
- Leveraged existing `permissions` table from Day 1
- Supports three roles: `viewer`, `editor`, `owner`
- Role hierarchy: viewer < editor < owner

### 2. Core Services

#### ShareService (`src/services/shareService.ts`)
- **Public Link Management**:
  - `generatePublicLink()` - Create secure public links with UUID tokens
  - `revokePublicLink()` - Remove public access
- **User Sharing**:
  - `shareWithUser()` - Share files with specific users by email
  - `removeUserPermission()` - Remove user access
- **Permission Management**:
  - `getFilePermissions()` - List all users with file access
  - `checkUserPermission()` - Verify user access and role
- **Public Access**:
  - `getPublicFileByToken()` - Access files via public tokens

#### Permission Middleware (`src/middleware/permissionMiddleware.ts`)
- **Role-Based Access Control**:
  - `checkPermission()` - Verify user permissions for file operations
  - `checkPublicAccess()` - Handle public file access
- **Security Features**:
  - Role hierarchy validation
  - Owner bypass for full access
  - Public file viewer access

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Sharing Routes (`src/routes/shareRoutes.ts`)
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/shares/:fileId/public` | Generate public link |
| DELETE | `/api/shares/:fileId/public` | Revoke public link |
| POST | `/api/shares/:fileId/user` | Share with user |
| DELETE | `/api/shares/:fileId/user/:userId` | Remove user permission |
| GET | `/api/shares/:fileId/permissions` | Get file permissions |
| GET | `/api/shares/:fileId/access` | Check user permission |
| GET | `/api/shares/public/:token` | Access public file |
| GET | `/api/shares/shared` | Get shared files |

#### Share Controller (`src/controllers/shareController.ts`)
- **Input Validation**: Email format, role validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization checks
- **Response Formatting**: Consistent API responses

### 4. File Service Integration

#### Enhanced FileService (`src/services/fileService.ts`)
- **Permission-Aware Operations**:
  - `checkFileAccess()` - Centralized permission checking
  - Updated all file operations to respect permissions
- **Role-Based Restrictions**:
  - Only owners can delete files
  - Only owners and editors can update files
  - Viewers have read-only access
- **Public File Support**:
  - Public files accessible to everyone
  - Secure token-based access

### 5. Security Features

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication for all protected endpoints
- Role-based access control for file operations
- Public file access without authentication

#### Security Measures
- Secure UUID generation for public tokens
- Permission validation on all file operations
- Owner-only restrictions for destructive operations
- Input validation and sanitization

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Files table (updated)
ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN public_token VARCHAR(255);

-- Permissions table (existing from Day 1)
CREATE TABLE permissions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  file_id UUID REFERENCES files(id),
  role VARCHAR(10) CHECK (role IN ('viewer', 'editor', 'owner')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT current_timestamp
);
```

### Permission Flow
1. **File Access Request** ‚Üí Check if user is owner
2. **Not Owner** ‚Üí Check if file is public
3. **Not Public** ‚Üí Check user permissions
4. **No Permission** ‚Üí Access denied
5. **Has Permission** ‚Üí Check role hierarchy for operation

### Role Hierarchy
```typescript
const roleHierarchy = { viewer: 1, editor: 2, owner: 3 };
```

## üß™ Testing Examples

### 1. Share a file with a colleague
```bash
# Upload a file
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/files/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -F "file=@document.pdf"

# Share with colleague
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/shares/file-uuid/user \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "colleague@company.com", "role": "editor"}'
```

### 2. Generate a public link
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/shares/file-uuid/public \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### 3. Access a public file
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/shares/public/abc123-def456
```

## üìä API Response Examples

### Successful Public Link Generation
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Public link generated successfully",
  "data": {
    "shareable_link": "http://localhost:3000/public/abc123-def456",
    "public_token": "abc123-def456"
  }
}
```

### File Permission Check
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "hasAccess": true,
    "role": "editor"
  }
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Insufficient permissions to update file"
}
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### 1. Permission Validation
- All file operations check user permissions
- Role hierarchy enforced for operations
- Owner bypass for full access

### 2. Public Link Security
- Secure UUID tokens for public access
- Links can be revoked at any time
- No authentication required for public files

### 3. Input Validation
- Email format validation
- Role validation (viewer, editor, owner)
- File ID and user ID validation

## üöÄ Integration Points

### 1. File Operations
- All existing file endpoints now respect permissions
- File upload creates owner-only access
- File updates require editor or owner role
- File deletion requires owner role

### 2. Folder Operations
- Folder sharing can be extended in future
- Current implementation focuses on file sharing

### 3. User Management
- User lookup by email for sharing
- Permission cleanup when users are deleted

## üìà Performance Considerations

### 1. Database Queries
- Efficient permission checking with indexed queries
- Minimal database calls for permission validation
- Caching opportunities for frequently accessed permissions

### 2. S3 Integration
- Signed URLs for secure file access
- No additional S3 calls for permission checking
- Efficient file metadata retrieval

## üéØ Next Steps (Future Days)

### Day 6: Search & Filtering
- Implement full-text search across shared files
- Add filtering by file type, size, sharing status
- Advanced search with permissions

### Day 7: Real-time Collaboration
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Live collaboration features
- Real-time permission changes

### Day 8: Advanced Sharing
- Link expiration dates
- Password-protected public links
- Bulk sharing operations
- Sharing analytics
